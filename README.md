## Fridge Model Hackathon Project

## Introduction
This project was developed during a hackathon with the goal of creating a fridge model application. The initial idea was to allow users to input ingredients they have in their fridges and receive recipes based on those ingredients. Additionally, we aimed to provide nutritional information for Indian food items using image recognition technology.

## Features
- **Recipe Generation**: Users can input ingredients and receive recipes based on those ingredients.
- **Nutritional Information**: Using image recognition, the application provides nutritional information, including calories per serving, for Indian food items.
- **Future Enhancements**: We aimed to integrate the DALL·E OpenAI API to generate images of recipes, but faced technical challenges during implementation.

## Technologies Used
- React
- Image recognition APIs
- DALL·E OpenAI API (planned)
- npm for package management
